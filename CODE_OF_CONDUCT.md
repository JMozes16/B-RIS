# B-RIS Code of Conduct

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers of B-RIS pledge to make participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, and expression, level of 
experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:
* Using welcoming and inclusive language.
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
* Focusing on what is best for the community.
* Showing empathy towards other community members.
* Being welcoming toward new members
* Being understanding of cultural differences
* Acknowledge and learn from mistakes.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
* Public or private harassment.
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
* Conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate for the forum in which it occurs.

## Conflict Resolution
Conflicts in an open source project can take many forms, from someone having a bad day and using harsh and hurtful language in the issue queue, to more serious instances such as sexist/racist statements or threats of violence, and everything in between.

However, for the vast majority of issues, we aim to empower individuals to first resolve conflicts themselves, asking for help when needed, and only after that fails to escalate further. This approach gives people more control over the outcome of their dispute.

If you are experiencing or witnessing conflict, we ask you to use the following escalation strategy to address the conflict:

1. Address the perceived conflict directly with those involved, preferably in a real-time medium.
2. If this fails, get a third party (e.g. a mutual friend, and/or someone with background on the issue, but not involved in the conflict) to intercede.
3. If you are still unable to resolve the conflict, and you believe it rises to harassment or another code of conduct violation, report it. Report the issue directly to the project managers (Josh Mozes, Shamar Samuels) or to the resources available at RPI: [Title IX Office@RPI](https://sexualviolence.rpi.edu/) and [Public Safety@RPI](https://publicsafety.rpi.edu/)

## Project Maintainer Responsibilities
Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. In the case of contributors external to RPI and/or RCOS, temporary or permanent bans may occur.

## RPI-Specific Policies
RPI-specific policies, including consequences for violating the RCOS Code of Conduct in the context of RCOS at RPI, can be found under our [Bylaws](https://rcos.github.io/rcos-handbook/#/community/bylaws). Please review these if you are a student, mentor, or Coordinator at RPI, as you will also be expected to follow these bylaws.
